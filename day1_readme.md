Day 1 Baby! You ready

Foundational - 6 months of fundamental AWS cloud and industry knowledge  - Cloud practitioner
Associate - 1 year - Solutions Architect, Developer, SysOps Administrator

How websites work
- client uses a network between ourserves and the server, the network routes the data and packet to the server and allows the client to view
- a client has an IP address and so does the Server, thats how they find one another

Server
- contains a CPU, does computations to find results
- RAM, stores info and retrieves quickly 
***these two act as a brain
- Storage: Data, we can also use a database to store it in a formatted way and query
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS Servers


IT TERMINOLOGY
- network is a bunch of cables, servers and routers
Rputer
Switch: takes a packet and sends it to the correct client on the network
CPU > ROUTER > SWITCH > DECIDE CLIENT

Data Centers
- traditional! hella servers, like the OG Jeff Bezos day. 

Problems with this 
- pay for rent for the data center 
- pat for colling, maintenance
- adding and replacing hardware
- scaling is limited
- hire a 24/7 team
- what is there is a natural disaster?
- what if you want to scale but cant afford space or money to buy more serves?

SHOUTOUT TO THE CLOUD

CLOUD COMPUTING 
- on demand delivery of CPU, DBS, apps and other IT resources
-  pay-as-you-go
- pick the size and type of computing resources
- you can access all resources instantly 
- cloud gives you a nice interface 
- AWS owns and maintains the hardware required for us to do everything

The cloud is filled with tons of servers, it's omnipresent but not visible.

Examples
- Gmail is a cloud service
- Dropbox is a cloud storage service, built on AWS
- Netflix is built on AWS, video on demand 


Deployment Models of the Cloud
1. Private cloud
- used by a single organization, used for security, control, to meet certian business needs
2. Public Cloud
- Cloud services owned by 3rd party and delivered via internet
- 3 Massive company examples are: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and AWS

5 Characteristics of Cloud computing 
1. On demand self service
- users can use whatever without provision
2. Broad network access
- can be accessed by diverse client platformsa
3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- customers can share the same infrastructure and apps with security and privacy, and be serviced from thre same physicsl resource 
4. Rapid elasticity and scalabilty 
- acquire and dispose resources at will, scale based on demand 
5. Measured Service
- users only pay for what they use
