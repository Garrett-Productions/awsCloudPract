How websites work
- client uses a network between ourserves and the server, the network routes the data and packet to the server and allows the client to view
- a client has an IP address and so does the Server, thats how they find one another

Server
- contains a CPU, does computations to find results
- RAM, stores info and retrieves quickly 
***these two act as a brain
- Storage: Data, we can also use a database to store it in a formatted way and query
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS Servers


IT TERMINOLOGY
- network is a bunch of cables, servers and routers
Rputer
Switch: takes a packet and sends it to the correct client on the network
CPU > ROUTER > SWITCH > DECIDE CLIENT

Data Centers
- traditional! hella servers, like the OG Jeff Bezos day. 

Problems with this 
- pay for rent for the data center 
- pat for colling, maintenance
- adding and replacing hardware
- scaling is limited
- hire a 24/7 team
- what is there is a natural disaster?
- what if you want to scale but cant afford space or money to buy more serves?
